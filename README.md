##### Deploy to distributed deployment with Search Head Pooling
Follow the same steps as *Install to search head*.
##### Deploy to distributed deployment with Search Head Clustering
Follow the same steps as *Install to search head*.
##### Deploy to Splunk Cloud
Follow the same steps as *Install to search head*.
#### Configure Cisco Networks Add-on

1. Install in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_ios

2. Create a UDP input on one of your Splunk servers or a forwarder with sourcetype set to *syslog* or *cisco:ios*. A regex match will be performed to rewrite the events to the cisco:ios sourcetype.
3. Configure your Cisco devices to send their syslogs to the UDP input created in step 2 with logging level informational.
